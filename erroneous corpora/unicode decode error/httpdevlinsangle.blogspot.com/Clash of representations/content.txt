Clash of representations








The pie chart in the above tweet jumped out of the page when it appeared in my twitter feed
on September 14. My initial shock at seeing the figure 1% attached to a region of the pie chart
that was evidently almost 25% of the total area of the disk did not last long, of course, since the
accompanying text made it clear what the diagram was intended to convey. The 1% label
referred to the section of the population being discussed, whereas the pie-chart indicated the
share of taxes paid by that group. Indeed, the image was an animated GIF; when I clicked on it,
the region labeled “1%” shrank, culminating with the chart on the right in the image shown
below:




But here’s the thing. Even after I had figured out what the chart was intended to convey, I still
found it confusing. I wondered if a lay-reader, someone who is not a professional
mathematician, would manage to parse out the intended meaning. It was not long before I
found out. The image below shows one of the tweets that appeared in response less than an
hour later:


As I had suspected, a common reaction was to dismiss the chart as yet another example of a
bad data visualization created by an innumerate graphics designer. Indeed, that had been my
initial reaction. But this particular example is more interesting. Yes, it is a bad graphic, for the
simple reason that it does not convey the intended message. But not because of the
illustrator’s innumeracy. In fact, numerically, it appears to be as accurate as you can get with a
pie chart. The before and after charts do seem to have regions whose areas correspond to the
actual data on the tax-payer population.


This example was too good to pass up as an educational tool: asking a class to discuss what the
chart is intended to show, could lead to a number of good insights into how mathematics can
help us understand the world, while at the same time having the potential to mislead. I was
tempted to write about it in my October post, but wondered if I should delay a couple of
months to avoid an example that was at the heart of a current, somewhat acrimonious party-political debate. As it turned out, the September 30 death of the game-show host Monty Hall
resolved the issue for me—I had to write about that—and then November presented another
“must do” story (the use of mathematics in election jerrymandering). So this month, with the
background political, tax votes now a matter of historical record, I have my first real
opportunity to run this story.


The two-month delay brought home to me just how problematic this particular graphic is. Even
knowing in advance what the issue is, I still found I had to concentrate to “see” the chart as
conveying the message intended. That “1%” label continued to clash with the relative area of
the labeled region.


It’s a bit like those college psychology-class graphics that show two digits in different font sizes,
and ask you to point to the digit that represents the bigger integer. If the font sizes clash with
the sizes of the integers, you take measurably longer to identify the correct one, as shown
below:


For me, the really big take-home lesson from the tax-proposal graphic is the power of two
different mathematical representations of proportions: pie charts and numerical percentages.
Each, on its own, is instant. In the case of the pie chart, the representation draws on the innate
human cognitive ability to judge relative areas in simple, highly symmetrical figures like circular
disks or rectangles. With percentages, there is some initial learning required—you have to
understand percentages—but once you have done that, you know instantly what is meant by
figures such as “5%” or “75%."


But how do you get that understanding of the meaning of numerical percentages? For most of
us (I suspect all of us), it comes from being presented (as children) with area examples like pie
charts and subdivided rectangles. This sets us up to be confused, bigly, by examples where
those two representations are used in the same graphic but with the percentage representing
something other than the area of the segment (or what that area is intended to represent).


The message then, from this particular example—or at least the message I got from it—is that
powerful graphics are like any powerful tool, their power for good depends on using them
wisely; if used incorrectly, they can confuse and mislead. And make no mistake about it,
numbers are incredibly powerful tools. Their invention alone is by far the greatest
mathematical invention in human history. That’s why in every nation in the world, math is the
only mandated school subject apart from the native language.
