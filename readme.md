Concieved of during late-night walks along Parsons Blvd in Jamaica, Queens. Parson is an exercise in what I now know to be called a [Markov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) modelling.  
I think of myself as a single-parent, but I suppose you could say Parson's father is the mathematician [Keith Devlin](http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com) whose texts I pilfered for training data.

If you happen to wonder what the "m3ta" library is, I've changed it's name to [sl4ng](./sl4ng).  
Soon I'll revisit this in go with word generation.
